 # Springs and curls similarity
 Have you ever notice that springs format is similar to hair curls? Yes, it is. And before we start the Physics speech I'm gonna present you the different kinds of curly hair and what causes that. We can also compare its format with springs.
 
 * callout(Tip):
 In the view beside you can drag the edge of the curl to make it move. Choose different types by clicking the post-its.
 
 ## Curly Hair's shape
 The shape that curly's hair make is a coil. There are equations that can describes how the coil will look in each dimensions.
 The X dimension is represented by a sine wave, and the y dimension by a cosine wave. The z dimension represents the length of the hair. You can check this in the image bellow:

 One complete curl is one complete cycle of the wave. The distance required to complete one full cycle in z dimension is what defines the curl type (1 to 4) which we'll see next. This curl shape equation can also be used to draw different kind of springs.
 
 ## Types of curls
 The Andre Walker hair typing system is the most widely used system to classify hair. The system shows four categories of hair types, all with subcategories that go into more detail.
 
 1. **Straight hair** : Don't have any curl.
 
 2. **Wavy hair** : The wavy hair shape looks like a sine wave.
 
 3. **Curly hair** : That's the one that looks like springs.
 
 4. **Coily hair** : Has a tightly coiled curl pattern.
 
 These are the 4 main types of hair, all of which come with subcategories from A to C. The subcategories tells if the hair is fine/thin, medium or coarse.
 
 - Note:
 Observe the behavior of the different curls when you pull it down. It happens because the thickness  of each one it's different and it affect their stiffness. Then we're gonna see how this stiffness actually affects the movement, mathematically speaking.
 
 ## What makes curly?
 Whether you have straight, wavy, curly, coily or kinky, your hair type is determined by the shape of the hair follicles. People with straight or wavy hair usually have round or oval shaped hair follicles, while people with curly, coily, or kinky hair have elliptical or flat shaped follicles.

 The shape and size of the hair follicle determines the type and thickness of the hair.
 That's why people all over the world have different types of hair. Actually, in the same head we can find different kind of curls. That's one of the things that makes us unique individuals.
