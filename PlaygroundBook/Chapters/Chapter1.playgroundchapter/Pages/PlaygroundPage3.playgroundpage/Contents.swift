 # The k constant
 Of course every spring is different, some are loose like a slinky and some are stiff. This factor is represented by the spring constant k, which will be unique to a particular spring.
 
 * callout(Tip):
 You can change the stiffness of the spring beside and simulate different k constants! Check the behavior of the spring with this differents paramethers.
 
 # The Hooke's Law
 The force that a spring can exert is equal to negative k times the displacement of the object it acts upon, and this relationship is called Hooke's law.
 
 `F = -k.x`
 
 _Where F indicates the force applied, k is the elasticity constant and x the displacement of the spring._
 
 The negative sign indicates that the force of the spring is always opposite the direction of the movement of the object like we saw before.
 
 The units on a spring constant will be Newtons per meter, so that when you multiply by some distance X, you get the force that must be applied to compress that spring that far.
 
 ## And the Curls?
 Like we saw before the curls have different stiffness just like the springs.
 
 + Note:
 Create different types of springs by changing its stiffness and number of repetitions. Try to guess which hair types your spring looks like.

 # Final Considerations
 
 In this playground you have learned a little more about Simples Harmonic Motions, Curl hair types and Hooke's Law. I really hope you have enjoyed this experience and seek to find other subjects that can be interesting to study by giving it a little real life context.
