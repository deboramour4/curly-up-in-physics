 # Physics in daily lives
 Most people's memories of their Physics and Math classes at school are probably associated with boring formulas, conventional problems and calculations. With no clear applications about it in the real world.
 
 But we tend to forget that Physics is a science about the world around us, about almost everything that surrounds people in their everyday lives.
 
 Learning physics can be more exciting than you think, just use everyday situations to make the comparisons. You'll discover it can be exciting, fun and understandable even for people who have no gift for it.
 
 In this playground we're gonna learn a little bit more about springs and elastic force and compare them with the different types of curly hairs!
